        <p>I will start by documenting my experience of web development so far.
            Let’s start by jumping straight into how I found the coding, it was fun learning how to code and design
            using both HTML and CSS, I’ve never used multiple languages simultaneously before, so it was quite
            interesting to do. I especially enjoyed the animations I had to make however I could not put them into the
            areas I wanted, and they appeared behind or underneath the page which I found quite annoying this also
            happened with my h2 tags, text boxes for my contact page as well as images, as such I was not able to
            utilise an
            animated background or fully complete pages however, I was able to make animations on a smaller concentrated
            scale like when hovering over the navigation anchors. <br><br>

            Design wise i chose a dark background and a white font as i was going to do a space theme however as stated
            before the animations didnt really pan out. <br><br>

            I would say the biggest problem though was my time management, I left the project to be completed for the
            last two weeks however the 2nd to last week I went back home for a couple days for a family birthday and the
            final week I spent revising for the other 2 modules as well which left little to no time for the website
            which I would say was the main problem. <br><br>

            Overall reflecting on my actions I believe if I worked on the project throughout the weeks of being taught
            and planning ahead or to a schedule, I believe I would have done much better which is why that will be the
            plan moving forward when starting other projects. <br><br>

            Ultimately it was fun to use but also quite finnicky. <br><br>
